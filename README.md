# free store website

The repository for the Grinnell SEC's Free Store website.  

The Free Store is a project at Grinnell College to re-use items that would otherwise have been discarded by students. The website is intended to display the items currently available in the Free Store, making it easier for students to know what is available without having to go directly.
